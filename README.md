As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

// In VR I have played Beat Saber, Seeking Dawn ( which isnt designed all that well and was a good example how using the sticks to move makes people sick), Job simulator, Vader episode one, and Virtual virtual reality, gorn, Richie's plank, medium, and quill. AR I have played Pokemon go.


## VR Lab 1: Working Title
// Prompt "feed the animals" The player will then use two hands to throw two hay bales into the animal pens. The player could use an apple too, either will work for this purpose.

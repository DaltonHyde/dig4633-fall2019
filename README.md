As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

// In VR I have played Beat Saber, Seeking Dawn ( which isnt designed all that well and was a good example how using the sticks to move makes people sick), Job simulator, Vader episode one, and Virtual virtual reality, gorn, Richie's plank, medium, and quill. AR I have played Pokemon go.


## VR Lab 1: Assemble the Scarecrow

Rumpelstiltskin

Players will assemble the scarecrow in front of them using the arms and hat on the table. It does not matter which item is put on first as long as they are all put into place.
The interactables are the left arm of scarecrow, right arm of scarecrow, and the hat of the scarecrow.The arms will go to the sides of the scarecrow body and the hat is placed
upon his head. The prompt indicating completion of the task will appear after pieces are in place.
